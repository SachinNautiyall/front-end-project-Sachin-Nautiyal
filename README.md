This is a front-end course project made by Sachi Nautiyal. It uses Netlify to deploy the project to a public domain so everyone can see it. If you want to run it locally, you can download my code from my GitHub: SachinNautiyall/front-end-project-main. I had problems with GitHub and could not commit to the same repository I started with, so the old repo is at : /SachinNautiyall/front-end-project-Previous-commits
